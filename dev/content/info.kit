        <p> At Roast we believe in the simple way of life. Our motto is, ‘if we can make it in house….we’re all about it!’ Environment is everything and Roast has become a homey yet hip place where neighbors, couples, artists, and business folk come to get the simplicities of home without having to do any of the work involved.
